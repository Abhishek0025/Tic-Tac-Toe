# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with React and Vite

## About the Project

This project is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **React** and **Vite**. The game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, with one player using "X" and the other using "O". The game checks for a winner and highlights the winning line once three of the same symbols are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players can reset the game after a win or draw.
