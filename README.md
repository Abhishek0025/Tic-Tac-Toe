# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and Vite. The game allows two players to take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. It checks for winners, highlights the winning line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), and allows the game to be reset after a win or a draw.
